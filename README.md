# Checkpoint 1 prep

Do the following exercises to prepare for checkpoint 1.

The first exercises have test files that you can run with `mocha`.

1. `battleship.js`
Create a funtion `battleship()` that generates a battleship board. A board is a grid with rows 1 to 10 and columns A to J.

*Run the tests* by doing `mocha battleship.test.js`

2. `shortestAndLongest.js`
Create a function `shortestAndLongest()` that takes an array of strings and returns the shortest and the longest strings.
*Run the tests* by doing `mocha shortestAndLongest.test.js`

3. `gridWithBootstrap.html`
Create a responsive grid with 24 images. The layouts should be the following:
```
Desktop: 4x6
Tablet: 2x12
Smartphone: 1x24

```
You can use a placeholder for the images like this one: https://via.placeholder.com/150
There are *no tests* for this exercise.

4. `gridWithFlex.html`
Do the same grid as before but this time using flexbox. You will probably use `@media` queries, so here are some screenwidths:
```
Tablet < 992px
Smartphone < 768px
```
There are *no tests* for this exercise.
